# Editors With Markdown Support
By this moment we have learned a lot of Markdown syntax, looked at [Flavored Markdown][previous] on different popular platforms - [Ghost][], [Github][]. It is time to look to desktop applications, is where any support to edit Markdown document outside the browser?

The truth is that [Markdown][] is OS agnostic, meaning you can easily write using Markdown syntax on PC at work, on Mac at home, on iPad or iPhone or even Android during lunch, on the bus, or whatever. This also means that there are plenty of editors with Markdown support. Your choice will probably depend on platform and price. So, let's look at some most modern editors keeping in mind these two characters.

<h2 id="mac-osx-markdown-editors">Mac OSX Markdown Editors</h2>
There are lots of Markdown apps to choose from, but your very first one should be [Mou][] (it is the best and free). 

* [Mou][] - <span class="awesome">Free</span>   
    Very straightforward and powerful editor (like Markdown itself), have lots of features - autosave, live preview, custom themes, etc. No distraction control panels, action buttons or mouse touching, everything can be done using keyboard or shortcuts. Nice!

* [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) - <span class="awesome">$9.99</span>  
    Another simple writing editor, no settings or configuration, just one typeface and two color modes, that's it, put your hands on keyboard and mind in the text. Unfortunately, not free.

* [ByWord](https://bywordapp.com/) - <span class="awesome">$11.99</span>  
    Very simple and efficient editor that lets you sync your documents between several devices, export to PDF, HTML, or even publish directly to the most popular blogging platforms.

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - <span class="awesome">$70</span>  
    Very powerful and packaged rich text editor has a lot of settings, configuration, additional packages. In comparison with other editors, it is a monster, it can do lots of stuff, but it will take a while to become familiar and setup environment.

## Windows PC Markdown Editors
At PC world we have two most popular editors to choose between - [WriteMonkey](http://writemonkey.com/) and [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) It is the first ones that you should probably look at.

* [WriteMonkey](http://writemonkey.com/) - <span class="awesome">Free</span>  
    Even it is PC world, but this editor is very light and fast, no menu bars, no distractions, full-screen mode, just you, your thoughts and your words.

* [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) - <span class="awesome">Free</span> + <span class="awesome">$14.99</span> for Pro version  
    It is a full-featured text editor that lets you work with several documents at once, lots of settings, configuration. Be aware that some features are only available in Pro version. It is probably the best choice who like to control and customize the environment.

* [Texts](http://www.texts.io/) - <span class="awesome">$19</span>  
    It is an excellent editor for ones who don't want to remember Markdown syntax but do want to format the text easily. It has only one view, all Markdown key characters are converted on the fly, or you can just type plain text and then apply style through menu items. Be aware it will require some additional install for normal work - [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) that is a universal document text converter. 

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - <span class="awesome">$70</span>  
    As you can see this editor has not only support on Mac OS X but also PC world. All features will be the same.
    
## Apple iOS Markdown Apps
Well, here we don't have free apps, unfortunately. But on the plus side, the ones that we do have here offer the nice cloud-sync feature that lets you use the same app across multiple devices.

* [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) - <span class="awesome">$4.99</span>  
  We have already discussed this editor in the section for [Mac OS X](#mac-osx-markdown-editors). As you can see it supports several platforms that make its cloud-sync feature very nice and powerful. You can start creating the document on Mac, then update it from your iPad or even switch to Android device as you will see later. If you do enjoy this editor on one platform, you will enjoy it on others.

* [ByWord](https://bywordapp.com/) - <span class="awesome">$5.99</span>  
  The same situation here, so if you do get familiar with its features and enjoy them on Mac, you will be satisfied with it on iOS.

## Google Android Markdown Apps
If you do prefer this platform above others, it is worth to spend time trying several and choose the best that fulfill all your needs; there are plenty of apps here. The best choice is [JotterPad X](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jotterpad.x), it should be your first stop at Android world.

* [JotterPad X](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jotterpad.x) - <span class="awesome">Free</span> + some paid features  
  Very sturdy and good-looking app, was built with design in mind, looks nice. And at the same time offers lots of features - sync with your [Dropbox][] account, local document storage, custom themes, etc.

* [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) - <span class="awesome">Free</span>  
  Our old friend, as you can see, it is the only editor that is presented on almost all platforms. So if you have lots of devices with different OS and wish to sync your documents between them - it is the best choice for you. 

* [MarkDrop](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.keepzero.markdrop) - <span class="awesome">Free</span>  
  Very nice editor with limited [Dropbox][] account sync, you can only publish to one folder there. But it does work on old devices that sometimes is a great advantage. 
  
* [Writer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jamesmc.writer) - <span class="awesome">Free</span>  
  Incredibly simple editor, some would say that it looks a little bit odd, out-of-time, but not bad at the end. Just text editor with no additional features, sync or customization. I would say it is a good choice to try Markdown syntax, but for serious writing, it is better to select something another.

If you don't find your editor here, the one you can enjoy most, don't give up, go to [google](https://www.google.ru/). There are so many different editors on different platforms on the Earth; it will take months to try them all and describe here. So, probably, your best editor is just waiting for your somewhere else.
