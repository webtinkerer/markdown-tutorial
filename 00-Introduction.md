## What is Markdown?
[Markdown][] is a simple way of structuring your plain text document so that it can be later easily converted into HTML document or PDF file, or even PowerPoint presentation. It is a powerful tool for people who do wish to bring simple formatting to their text without fighting with complex markup languages, distraction applications, and mouse touching. In the core with just a couple of extra key characters, Markdown makes beautiful rich document formatting very quickly. It is fast, simple, pain-free and specially built for people who write for the web a lot.

## When was it created?
It was created by writer and blogger [John Gruber][] (of [Daring Fireball][]) with significant collaboration from [Aaron Swartz][] in 2004. Their goal was to enable non-programming people «to write using an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, and optionally convert it to structurally valid HTML» without a headache.

## What new does it bring? 
It brings pure writing flow when there is nothing between you and paper. You can easily start putting your thoughts down, no distraction to text appearance, styling, heterogeneous syntax or mouse touching. It is leaving you alone with your thoughts and your words. It seems like in ancient times - the ton of white paper, the typewriter and you. It brings to the stage what matters - writing and producing rich text, **His Majesty - Content**. 

## How does it work?

You can apply Markdown syntax in any text editor, but at the end, you will also need some markdown-supported text processor to display the output formatted as an HTML document. Keep in mind that nowadays there are a ton of different web and desktop applications that already support either simple Markdown syntax or its full specification.
